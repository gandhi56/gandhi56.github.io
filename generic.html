								I was gifted my first laptop from my parents in 2005. Two years later, I wrote my first computer program in a turtle graphics language called LOGO. I learned BASIC from my middle school and developed several GUI application softwares using Visual Basic. After I completed my fourth grade, I took coaching classes to learn C. Besides developing application software, I played competitive chess with experience competing in district and provincial level tournaments.
							</p>

							<p>
								I learned Python in my high school Computer Science class. I developed simulations and games using the Pygame library. I participated in the Iverson exam in grade 10, this exam introduced me to the field of algorithms. My team ranked first place in the Iverson exam which was held in 2017. I also participated in several math contests in my high school career. I was a high school intern at the University of Alberta assisting the development of a reinforcement learning platform.
							</p>

							<p>
								I attended the programming club meetings at the University of Alberta during my high school internship. Algorithmic problem solving was completely novel to me but I found it quite enjoyable. I continued attending these meetings since high school, as regularly as I can. I have gained an abundant volume of knowledge regarding algorithms and data structures through the programming club at the University of Alberta. Consequently, I am motivated to practice for programming contests and become a strong competitive programmer.
							</p>

							<p>
								During high school, I persuaded myself to explore various areas in Computing science and find the ideal area for myself. By the end of first year in my undergraduate degree, due to my distinguished passion for algorithm design, I decided to inflame my mind with advanced algorithms and data structures. Indeed, my will to perform well in programming contests has impacted highly towards my future career options. Moreover, I believe having insight into various algorithms is essential to become a competent programmer and a computer scientist.
							</p>

								I performed quite poorly in every programming contest I participated in my first year. However, my enthusiasm encouraged me to work hard and within a span of four months, I earned a 6-star badge on the Hackerrank coding platform. I was selected in one of three teams representing the University of Alberta at the Rocky Mountain Regional Contest 2018. My team ranked 23 out of 65 teams. In March of 2019, I competed in the UAPC where my team ranked third place. After my second year, I interned at the NexOptic Technology Corporation. Along with my internship, I spent most of my spare time training on the Open Kattis coding platform for the regional contest that was coming soon. My team ranked third place in the Rocky Mountain Regional Contest 2019 with a Silver medal on site. I also participated in Communitech's Code to Win challenge, where I ranked in the top 75 out of roughly 1000 participants across Canada and was invited to the Waterloo region to compete in the final round of the Code to Win challenge. Besides my participation in programming contests, I participated in the HackEd 2019 where my team worked on a graph drawing tool called EulerTikz. I was also a member of the software team in a student group at the University of Alberta, AlbertaSat.

								Along with algorithms and data structures, I am also interested in compilers. I have briefly studied the LLVM infrastructure and have gone through LLVM's Kaleidoscope tutorial. Following these tutorials, I learned about ANTLR4 and I decided to develop a compiler using the tools that I have recently learned. My experience so far with my compiler Ammo has really improved my C++, C++11 in particular. Moreover, I took a compiler design course at the University of Alberta where I implemented a compiler for the Gazprea programming language in a team of four. As of December 7, 2020, I am ranked 208th on the Kattis judging platform, Kattis indeed enhances my capabilities as a programmer.

								On February 3 of 2021, I was offered a GPU compiler engineer position at AMD - I was happier than ever. I finished my Bachelor's degree and started working at AMD on May 3, 2021. I must say, working at AMD is a huge privilege, with lots of knowledge sharing and creation on a daily basis.
							</p>

							<p>
								I attended EuroLLVM 2022 which was held in London, England on May 10, 11. This was my first time visiting the city and it was exhilirating. The English architecture is quite extraordinary, I also had a chance to visit King's cross station where Harry and his friends started their journey to become wizards! The EuroLLVM 2022 conference was my first time meeting my AMD and LLVM colleagues in person. I had the pleasure of meeting some of the brightest minds working in this field of languages and compilers. It was quite the experience I would cherish for the eternity.
							</p>

							<p>
								My life is mostly filled with tech stuff but not completely. I enjoy playing sports like badminton, cricket, basketball, soccer, and ping pong. I also really loved skiing when I tried for the first time, I want to ski more often! Moreover, I enjoy reading books and the triathletics - running, biking and swimming.
